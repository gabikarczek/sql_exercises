# ˗ˏˋ sql_exercises  ˎˊ˗
The aim of this repository is to utilize the basic skills I acquired during a _database-oriented_ university course by completing different SQL exercises. 

In the folder **university_project**, I have also uploaded my project done for the aforementioned course. The project includes the creation of a database from scratch, example queries and possible procedures, functions, as well as views. ˚ 🦢・₊✧
